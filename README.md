# AlgorithmicMadness

IMPORTANT!

The Gutil.java has to be executed in order to use the algorithms. In the Gutil constructor, uncomment any instances of algorithms, debugging tools or adjust the source of the graph. It allows us to test the algorithms in any order or just 1 at a time.

SetTools.java includes some low level tools to ease working with sets. Functions as: intersection, union, remove, removeset.
GraphTools.java includes additional shared tools for the algorithms. For example, you can test if the Graph coloring is fully valid etc.
